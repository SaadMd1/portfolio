## The Brief

Roast & Co., a beloved local coffee roaster, wanted to expand into retail stores. They needed packaging that would scale from their small-batch operation while maintaining their artisanal credibility.

## Design Approach

We created a flexible label system that:
- Accommodates multiple roast varieties
- Tells the origin story of each coffee
- Works across different bag sizes
- Maintains strong shelf presence

## Visual Identity

The design features:
- Bold, condensed typography
- Custom illustrations for each origin
- Unified color-coding system
- Tactile, matte finish

## Results

The new branding and packaging helped Roast & Co. secure distribution in over 50 retail stores within 6 months and increased social media engagement by 120%.
