## Project Overview

Lumière Skincare approached us to create a complete packaging system for their new luxury skincare line. The brand targets sophisticated millennials who value both efficacy and sustainability.

## Design Philosophy

We developed a packaging system that balances luxury aesthetics with environmental responsibility:
- Refillable glass bottles to reduce waste
- Magnetic closure boxes with minimal adhesive
- Soft-touch coating on recycled cardboard
- Debossed logo for premium tactile experience

## Packaging System

The system includes:
- Primary packaging (bottles, jars, tubes)
- Secondary packaging (boxes, sleeves)
- Outer shipping packaging
- Sample/travel sizes

## Impact

The packaging played a crucial role in securing €2M in Series A funding and generated over 5,000 pre-orders in the first month.
