## Project Goals

Origin Chocolate Co. crafts small-batch, bean-to-bar chocolate and needed packaging that communicated their dedication to quality and transparency about cacao origins.

## Design Strategy

We developed a system that tells each chocolate's story:
- Map illustrations showing cacao origin
- Flavor profile graphics
- Behind-the-scenes maker photography
- Transparent tasting notes

## Material Selection

Thoughtful material choices enhance the unboxing experience:
- Textured paper with satisfying hand-feel
- Inner foil wrapper for freshness
- Belly band as collectible element
- Embossed branding

## Business Results

The distinctive packaging helped Origin Chocolate Co. expand to national distribution and supported a 30% price premium over competitors.
