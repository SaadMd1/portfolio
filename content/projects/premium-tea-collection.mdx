## Creative Brief

Serene Leaves Tea sought packaging that reflected their commitment to quality and their inspiration from traditional Japanese tea ceremony. The packaging needed to work for both everyday use and premium gift sets.

## Design Concept

Drawing inspiration from wabi-sabi philosophy, we created:
- Minimal, harmonious compositions
- Subtle textural elements
- Muted, sophisticated color palette
- Metallic accents suggesting quality

## Packaging Structure

The system includes:
- Reusable metal tins for loose tea
- Nested gift boxes with magnetic closures
- Individual tea pouches
- Seasonal limited editions

## Performance

Gift set sales increased 200% during the holiday season, and the brand achieved an impressive 85% repeat purchase rate, partly attributed to the collectible tin designs.
