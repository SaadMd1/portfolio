## The Challenge

Golden Harvest Honey Co. needed a packaging redesign that would communicate their premium, organic positioning while standing out in a crowded market. The existing packaging felt dated and didn't convey the brand's commitment to sustainability and quality.

## Research & Strategy

We conducted extensive competitor analysis and shopper research to understand the premium honey category. Key insights:
- Consumers associate hexagonal patterns and gold accents with quality honey
- Transparency (literal and figurative) builds trust
- Sustainability is increasingly important to the target demographic

## Design Solution

The new design features:
- Clean, minimal aesthetic with a focus on the product
- Custom hexagonal pattern inspired by honeycomb
- Embossed label on FSC-certified paper
- Clear hierarchy emphasizing "organic" and origin story

## Results

The redesign led to a 45% increase in sales within the first three months and significantly improved shelf presence, resulting in three times more retailer inquiries.
