## Project Background

GreenBite Snacks wanted to launch a new line of plant-based snacks with packaging that matched their zero-waste commitments. The challenge was creating appealing, functional packaging that was also 100% compostable.

## Sustainability Strategy

We developed a comprehensive sustainability approach:
- Home-compostable film material
- Water-based, non-toxic inks
- Minimal packaging layers
- Clear disposal instructions

## Design Execution

The visual identity celebrates nature and transparency:
- Vibrant botanical illustrations
- Clear ingredient photography
- Educational sustainability messaging
- Playful, approachable typography

## Market Impact

GreenBite Snacks sold over 1 million units in their first year and won three industry awards for sustainable packaging innovation.
